"To connect to the node from a login node, use the following command:

ssh $USER@$NODE

To connect to the node from your local machine with vscode to the cluster node $NODE:
- You need to have the Dev Container extension installed in vscode.
- You need to have an SSH key pair in your home directorys:
    The public key should be in /home/$USER/.ssh/authorized_keys on the cluster
    The private key should be in C:/Users/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa_openssh (it is recommended to use this name, makes copying easier, see below)
    You can use Puttygen to generate the key pair on Windows. 
- you need to prepare the config file for the SSH connection:
    (if you have connected with vscode to $NODE before you can skip this step)

    Create a C:/Users/$USER/.ssh/config file, if it does not exist.
    Add the following content, if you have never connected to $NODE:
    Host $NODE
      HostName $NODE.service
      User $USER
      IdentityFile C:/Users/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa_openssh
      ProxyJump $USER@login02.cluster.zalf.de:22

- Select Remote Explorer in the left menu, you can now choose $NODE in the list of SSH Targets.
- Select $NODE, enter your passphrase for the SSH key, if you have set one. It will ask twice.
- Once you are connected, select the "Open Folder" option
- Select the folder you want to work in. It will ask again for your passphrase for the SSH key, twice.
- 

 If you have problems with setting up the connection. Please contact your MAS admin.
 Please send us a note if you think we can improve this explanation.
